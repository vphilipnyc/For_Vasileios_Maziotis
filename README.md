To run, use:

./gradlew bootRun


This project contains what you should need to update a patient and add drugs, and give you an idea how to structure the code better.  Form validation/error messages are left for you to do, as are some of the other methods in the controller.

But try to name variables consistently and write as little code as possible while still having it make sense for the next person to read.   Learn more about Spring too because it does a lot of the work for you if you use it properly.

Lastly, there are no unit tests.  These are really important to have to make sure your code works as you continue.
